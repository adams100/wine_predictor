# wine_predictor
Using Python's Scikit-Learn to predict wine quality and type across multiple types of models. 

Dataset was taken from 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine

Machine learning analysis predicing wine type with approx 99% accuracy and wine quality (2-9pnt scale) with approx 80% accuracy given the <strong>Machine Learning Features:</strong>
(fixed acidity,	volatile acidity,	citric acid, residual sugar,	chlorides,	free sulfur dioxide,	total sulfur dioxide,	density,	pH,	sulphates,	alcohol)



Models used: <br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Random Forest,<br>
K Neighbors Classifier,<br>
Support Vector Classification,<br>

Results are given using classification reports, Confusion Matrix report, and model parameters are tuned using GridSearchCV!
